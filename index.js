// PARTS OF A URL

// URL http://www.example.com/home/
// scheme  | host           | path

// The "scheme" identifies the protocol being used. This
// is typically HTTP or HTTPS.

// The "host" identifies the domain that holds the server.

// The "path" identifies the specific resource we want to
// access on the server.

// This tells our app to respond to a GET request.
// Only if that request is that path of "/home".
// When a GET request is made to "/home", the callback
// is called. Inside of it, this is where we write the
// code that will create the response to the client.

// The name of method, get, identifies this as a response
// to a GET request. This is the HTTP verb often called the
// method. Most interactions in browser cause a GET request
// to be made to a server (e.g. clicking a link, typing
// a url in the address bar, etc.)
app.get("/home", (request, response) => {
  // The `request` argument is object that represents
  // the request being by a client to server. It contains
  // everything that is needed to respond to the client.

  // The `response` argument is object that represents
  // the server's reply to the client. We are response
  // for the building and sending it.
