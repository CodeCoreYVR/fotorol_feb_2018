// ROUTERS

// PARTS OF A URL

// URL http://www.example.com/contact_us/?fullName=Steve+Godin&message=+What+is+up%3F
// scheme  | host           | path      | query string


// The "query" string is way to data in the URL. Data formatted
// uses URL encoding.
// ?fullName=Steve+Godin&message=+What+is+up%3F
// ? indicates that a query string is beginning
// In "fullName=Steve+Godin", fullName is the key and
// Steve+Godin is a value. Key-value are seperated by =.
// Then, key-value pairs are seperated by `&`.

// The "scheme" identifies the protocol being used. This
// is typically HTTP or HTTPS.

// The "host" identifies the domain that holds the server.

// The "path" identifies the specific resource we want to
// access on the server.

// This tells our app to respond to a GET request.
// Only if that request is that path of "/home".
// When a GET request is made to "/home", the callback
// is called. Inside of it, this is where we write the
// code that will create the response to the client.

// The name of method, get, identifies this as a response
// to a GET request. This is the HTTP verb often called the
// method. Most interactions in browser cause a GET request
// to be made to a server (e.g. clicking a link, typing
// a url in the address bar, etc.)
router.get("/home", (request, response) => {
  // The `request` argument is object that represents
  // the request being by a client to server. It contains
  // everything that is needed to respond to the client.

  // The `response` argument is object that represents
  // the server's reply to the client. We are response
  // for the building and sending it.
  response.send("Welcome at CodeCore! ðŸ’»");

  // the cookie-parser will transform into its original data type.
  // This called serializing.
  if (things) {
    response.cookie("things", things.split(/,/));
  }

  // To create local variables inside of templates, pass
  // an object as a second argument to response.render().
  // All key-values of that object will become variables inside
  // of the template where its keys will be the variable names.
